# ISMIN MNIST project
Contains the machine learning project (Mnist dataset) of the ISMIN course of the Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne.
This includes the data we have worked with, the Python script we produced and a PDF report.  
Ideally the script is meant to be run cell by cell after setting the working directory.
