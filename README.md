# ISMIN MNIST project
Contains the machine learning project (Mnist dataset) of the ISMIN course of the Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne.
This includes the data we have worked with, the Python script we produced and a PDF report.  
Ideally the script is meant to be run cell by cell after setting the working directory.  

The data file MNIST is too heavy to be directly available from GitHub, it can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1maiQwqLoT9uo95efJnQAdws9A68f4Paq/view?usp=sharing
